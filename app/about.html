<span> This app is inspired by the concept of genetic algorithms, which attempt to generate solutions to optimization problems. Here, the problem is getting as close as possible to a target color.
While this is hardly difficult problem (heck, we know the RGB values!), the app serves more as a simulation of genetic algorithms themselves and can be used as a teaching tool.

I hope you enjoyed this little app! If you have any queries, questions, or quandaries feel free to email me at atallahhezbor@gmail.com  </span>
